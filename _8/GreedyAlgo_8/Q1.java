Q1. Find the minimum sum of Products of two arrays of the same size, given that k modifications
are allowed on the first array. In each modification, one array element of the first array can either
be increased or decreased by 2.
Examples:
Input: a[] = {1, 2, -3}
       b[] = {-2, 3, -5}
       k = 5
Output: -31
Explanation:
Here n = 3 and k = 5.
So, we modified a[2], which is -3 and
increased it by 10 (as 5 modifications
are allowed).
Final sum will be :
(1 * -2) + (2 * 3) + (7 * -5)
-2 + 6 - 35
-31
(which is the minimum sum of the array
with given conditions)

Input: a[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 4}
       b[] = {3, 4, 2, 3, 2}
       k = 3
Output: 25
Explanation:
Here, total numbers are 5 and total
modifications allowed are 3. So, modify
a[1], which is 3 and decreased it by 6
(as 3 modifications are allowed).
Final sum will be :
(2 * 3) + (-3 * 4) + (4 * 2) + (5 * 3) + (4 * 2)
6 â€“ 12 + 8 + 15 + 8
25
(which is the minimum sum of the array with given conditions)
