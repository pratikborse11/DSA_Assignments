Problem 1: given a number, print its binary representation. [easy]
        Input 1: number = 5
        Output 1: 101
        Input 2: number = 10
        Output 2: 1010

    5 is the decimal number
2 | 5
—----
2 | 2 1
—----
2 | 1 0
Reading numbers is reverse order gives us 101 as the binary representation
2. Number 10
2 | 10
—-----
2 | 5 0
—-----
2 | 2 1
—-----
2 | 1 0
Reading in reverse order from bottom to top gives us 1010 as the binary representation of 10.
